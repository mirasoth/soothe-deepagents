"""Unit tests for StateBackend.

StateBackend requires a LangGraph graph execution context (get_config()).
Functional tests (write/read/edit/ls/grep/glob) are covered by
TestStateBackendConfigKeys in test_end_to_end.py using create_deep_agent
with a fake model.  This file only contains tests that don't need graph
context: error messages for operations outside graph execution.
